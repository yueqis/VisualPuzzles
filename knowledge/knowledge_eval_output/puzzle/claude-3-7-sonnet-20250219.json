        "answer": "To solve a simple linear equation, isolate the variable on one side of the equation by performing inverse operations. This may involve adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing both sides of the equation by the same number to maintain equality. Simplify each side as needed until the variable is isolated.",
        "pred": "# Solving a Simple Linear Equation\n\nA linear equation is an equation where the variable appears only with a power of 1. Here's the step-by-step process for solving it:\n\n## 1. Simplify both sides\n* Combine like terms on each side\n* Perform any indicated operations (multiplication, division)\n\n## 2. Isolate variable terms on one side\n* Move all terms with the variable to one side (typically the left)\n* Move all constant terms to the other side\n* Remember: When moving terms, change their signs (addition becomes subtraction and vice versa)\n\n## 3. Combine like terms again\n* Simplify the variable terms on one side\n* Simplify the constant terms on the other side\n\n## 4. Isolate the variable\n* Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable\n* This gives the value of the variable\n\n## 5. Check your solution\n* Substitute your answer back into the original equation\n* Verify that it creates a true statement\n\n### Example:\nFor the equation 3x + 4 = 2x - 5:\n1. Move variable terms to left: 3x - 2x = -5 - 4\n2. Simplify: x = -9\n3. Check: 3(-9) + 4 = 2(-9) - 5\n   -27 + 4 = -18 - 5\n   -23 = -23 ✓\n\nThis systematic approach works for any simple linear equation.",

Make abstract concepts concrete \n2. Transfer understanding from familiar domains to unfamiliar ones\n3. Highlight structural similarities rather than surface features\n4. Provide a framework for reasoning about new situations\n\nWhen used effectively, analogies help people understand complex relationships by mapping them onto relationships they already comprehend.",

Understanding this allows one to predict how the arrangement will appear from different angles, such as from the front, top, and sides, which is essential for matching these views to a given figure.",
        "pred": "# Arrangements of Identical Cubes and Their Views\n\nWhen identical cubes are arranged to form a three-dimensional figure, we create what is often called a \"polycube\" - the three-dimensional analog of polyominoes. These arrangements have interesting properties related to their visual representation from different perspectives.\n\n## Creating Polycubes\n\nIdentical cubes can be arranged in countless ways to create 3D structures where:\n- Each cube shares at least one face with another cube\n- Cubes are connected face-to-face (not just at edges or corners)\n- No gaps or overlaps exist between cubes\n\nSome notable examples include:\n- Simple shapes like 2×2×2 cubes or 3×1×1 \"sticks\"\n- L-shapes, T-shapes, and other irregular configurations\n- More complex structures like \"stairs\" or maze-like arrangements\n\n## Orthographic Projections (Standard Views)\n\nWhen analyzing a 3D structure made of cubes, we typically consider three standard orthographic projections:\n\n1. **Top view** (looking from above on the y-axis)\n2. **Front view** (looking straight on from the z-axis)\n3. **Side view** (looking from the x-axis)\n\nThese projections create 2D representations that show the \"silhouette\" or shadow of the 3D structure. For cube arrangements, these projections often result in grid patterns where:\n- Each cell in the grid is either filled or empty\n- The filled areas represent where at least one cube exists along that line of sight\n\n## Key Relationship: Projection Ambiguity\n\nAn important mathematical concept emerges: **different 3D arrangements can produce identical sets of orthographic projections**. This means that:\n\n- Given only the top, front, and side views, there may be multiple possible 3D structures that satisfy these projections\n- The minimum number of cubes needed to satisfy a set of projections is a mathematical problem in itself\n\n## Applications and Extensions\n\nThis relationship between 3D structures and their projections has applications in:\n\n1. **Spatial reasoning puzzles**: Given certain views, construct the 3D structure\n2. **Computer graphics**: Reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images\n3. **Computational geometry**: Determining minimum-cube reconstructions\n\n## Mathematical Analysis\n\nThe mathematical relationship can be formalized: if we have binary matrices T, F, and S representing the top, front, and side views respectively, then a cube exists at position (x,y,z) if and only if:\n- T[x,y] = 1\n- F[y,z] = 1\n- S[x,z] = 1\n\nThis demonstrates how the three orthogonal views constrain but don't uniquely determine the 3D arrangement of cubes.\n\nIn conclusion, the arrangement of identical cubes to form 3D structures creates a rich field of study related to projection, reconstruction, and visual representation in three-dimensional space.",

        "pred": "# Symmetry in Geometric Figures\n\nSymmetry occurs when a figure can be divided or transformed in a way that creates identical or matching parts. It's a fundamental concept in geometry that creates balance and order in shapes.\n\n## Types of Symmetry\n\n### 1. Reflectional Symmetry (Line Symmetry)\n- A figure has reflectional symmetry when it can be divided by a line so that one half is the mirror image of the other\n- The dividing line is called the **line of symmetry** or **axis of symmetry**\n- Examples: \n  * An isosceles triangle has one line of symmetry\n  * A rectangle has two lines of symmetry\n  * A regular hexagon has six lines of symmetry\n  * The letter 'A' has one line of symmetry\n\n### 2. Rotational Symmetry\n- A figure has rotational symmetry when it can be rotated around a fixed point (center) by a certain angle less than 360° and appear unchanged\n- The **order of rotational symmetry** is the number of distinct orientations in which the figure appears unchanged during a complete 360° rotation\n- Examples:\n  * A rectangle has order 2 rotational symmetry (looks the same after 180° rotation)\n  * A regular pentagon has order 5 rotational symmetry\n  * The letter 'Z' has order 2 rotational symmetry\n\n### 3. Translational Symmetry\n- Occurs in patterns that repeat by sliding or shifting without rotation or reflection\n- Common in tessellations, wallpaper patterns, and friezes\n- Example: A repeated pattern of triangles in a line that extends infinitely\n\n### 4. Point Symmetry (Origin Symmetry)\n- A special case of rotational symmetry where a figure remains unchanged after a 180° rotation around a point\n- Every point has a corresponding point the same distance from the center but in the opposite direction\n- Examples: The letter 'S', number '8', and parallelograms\n\n### 5. Glide Reflectional Symmetry\n- Combines translation with reflection\n- Example: Human footprints in sand - each footprint is a reflection of the other, but also translated forward\n\nSymmetry appears throughout nature, art, architecture, and design, making it not just a mathematical concept but an aesthetic principle that resonates across many disciplines.",
